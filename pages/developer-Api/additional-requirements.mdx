# 3. Additional Considerations

Beyond basic endpoint usage, there are a few critical aspects to keep in mind when working with **Hushh Developer APIs**. These considerations help ensure that your integrations remain **seamless, secure, and fully compliant** with global data protection standards.

## 3.1 Consent Flow

### **Overview**
Hushh places **user consent** at the heart of data sharing. Even if a user’s data exists in Hushh, your application **must explicitly request user permission** to access it. This ensures **privacy, transparency, and compliance** with regulations like **GDPR**.

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **Attempt Data Retrieval**
   - If consent has already been granted, the API will return the requested data.
   - If consent is missing, you receive a message:
     > **"You don’t have permission to access the data. Please request consent from the user."**

2. **Request Consent**
   - Call the `POST /api/v1/request-consent` endpoint to prompt the user.
   - The user sees your application’s details (**developer info, brand name, etc.**) and decides whether to accept or reject.

3. **Immediate 3-Minute Window**
   - Hushh keeps the request **open for 3 minutes** for an **instant response**:
     - ✅ **Consent Granted**: You can immediately access the data.
     - ❌ **Consent Rejected**: You cannot access the data.

4. **24-Hour Pending**
   - If the user does not act within the **3-minute window**, the request remains **pending for 24 hours**.
   - Your application will receive a message:
     > **"Consent request sent and awaiting user acceptance. Please check again after 24 hours."**

5. **Check Status**
   - After **24 hours** (or anytime in between), check if the user has responded.
   - Once **consent is granted**, subsequent **data retrieval calls should succeed**.

### **Best Practices**
✅ **Request Consent Only When Needed**: Avoid overwhelming the user with multiple consent prompts.  
✅ **Provide Context**: Clarify why the data is needed and how it benefits the user.  
✅ **Handle Pending Status Gracefully**: If consent is pending, inform the user that data will be available once they respond.

## 3.2 Security & Privacy

### **Data Protection**
🔐 **Encryption in Transit**: All requests and responses with Hushh APIs occur over **HTTPS (TLS/SSL)** to prevent interception.  
🔐 **Storage Encryption**: Sensitive data at rest is **encrypted** to mitigate unauthorized access within Hushh’s infrastructure.

### **Key & Token Management**
🔑 **API Key Security**: Never expose your API key in public repositories or client-side code. Treat it as a **secret**.  
🔑 **Session Tokens**: Automatically **expire after a set time**. Re-generate as needed to maintain **secure communication**.  
🔑 **Revocation**: If your key or token is **compromised**, revoke and regenerate credentials promptly.

### **Access Control**
✔️ **Granular Permissions**: Hushh enforces **user-level permissions** through explicit **consent checks**.  
✔️ **Least Privilege**: Request **only the data your application truly needs**, reducing **risk in the event of unauthorized access**.

## 3.3 GDPR & Compliance

### **GDPR Commitment**
Hushh is fully committed to the principles of the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, ensuring that personal data is:

- ✅ **Processed Lawfully, Fairly, and Transparently**
- ✅ **Collected for Specified, Explicit, and Legitimate Purposes**
- ✅ **Minimized** to what is necessary for your application’s legitimate purpose.
- ✅ **Accurate and Up-to-Date**
- ✅ **Stored Securely** with strong encryption and strict access controls.
- ✅ **Retained Only as Necessary** for the purposes authorized by the user.

### **User Rights**
Under GDPR, users have the right to:

🔹 **Withdraw Consent**: They can revoke data sharing at any point.  
🔹 **Data Portability**: Users can request their data in a structured, commonly used format.  
🔹 **Data Erasure**: They can ask to have their data removed or anonymized.

### **Developer Responsibilities**
🛡️ **Transparent Usage**: Clearly communicate to users **how and why** their data is being processed in your app.  
🛡️ **Honoring Requests**: If users request **deletion or withdrawal of consent**, ensure your application **stops retrieving or storing** their data.  
🛡️ **Data Minimization**: Only request **data relevant to your service** or product requirements.
